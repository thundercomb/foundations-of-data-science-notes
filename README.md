# Notes: Foundations of Data Science

These are my learning notes as I make my way through Blum, Hopcroft, and Kannan's [*Foundations of Data Science*](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B081HT4K2K/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). The book assumes a lot of the foundation material, and as I attempt to fill in the gaps while I learn I note down explanations, references, and material that I have found useful in my understanding.
